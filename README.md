# FakeNewsDetectionModel

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze text data and classify news articles as real or fake. The model helps combat misinformation by identifying unreliable news sources.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Multiple Approaches – Uses both Logistic Regression (TF-IDF) and LSTM (Deep Learning) for fake news classification.

✅ Pre-Trained Model Support – Loads an existing model if available, avoiding unnecessary retraining.

✅ Text Preprocessing – TF-IDF vectorization for better feature extraction.

✅ Deep Learning Support – Implements an LSTM neural network for advanced text analysis.

✅ Efficient Training & Inference – Saves trained models and vectorizers for future use.

✅ High Accuracy – Optimized model with TF-IDF + Logistic Regression or LSTM-based classification.

✅ Deployment Ready – Can be integrated into a web API using Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.
